RACore is a lightweight, general-purpose plugin designed for Minecraft anarchy servers that provides essential quality-of-life features without restricting gameplay.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Discord Reminders**: Automatic bold blue Discord invite messages broadcasted every 10 minutes
- **Cooldown System**: Basic cooldown tracking framework for future command implementations

### Quality of Life
- Lightweight and optimized for performance
- No gameplay restrictions or rules enforcement
- Simple configuration (currently minimal setup required)

## Installation

1. Download the latest `RACore.jar` from Releases
2. Place the jar file in your server's `plugins/` folder
3. Restart your server

## Configuration

Currently, RACore requires no configuration files. All features work out-of-the-box with default settings.

To modify the Discord reminder message or interval, you'll need to edit the plugin code and recompile as we are making everything as lightweight as possible.

## Planned Features

- Random player teleportation command
- Player head collection system
- Advanced cooldown management
- Basic grief prevention utilities
- Performance optimization tools
